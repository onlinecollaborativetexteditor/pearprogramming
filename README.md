# PearProgramming

An online, collaborative text editor that helps teams work on their code together

This application uses React, SCSS, Node, Express, and PostgreSQL as well as Axios, BrowserRouter, Monaco Editor, Socket.io, Bcrypt, and S3

The editor only currently supports JavaScript, but more languages are in the works...
